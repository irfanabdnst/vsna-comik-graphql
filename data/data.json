        "description": "The bow is a weapon that dominates everything in sight, even for targets hiding at distances too far for the eyes to see. Just imagine a weapon you cannot even see targeting your life. What could possibly be scarier than that? A training regime from hell with a brutal grandfather. A joyful trip to Zhongyuan in search of a wife. The rise of a hero who will overturn the Murim world. Ki Guided Arrow - a fresh take on Ki Guidance that is stronger than both the Ki Guided Sword and Blade! Fire the arrow into tomorrow!",
